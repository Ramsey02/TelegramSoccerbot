since i cannot use get_common_chats() to check the common groupchats between the bot and the player,
then there are two options here:
1) the player must specify by himself which is the groupchat he wants to register in, and admin can check if
he is indeed a member and register him
2) the player sends commands in the groupchat, which is easier but not as clean imo as the first option
